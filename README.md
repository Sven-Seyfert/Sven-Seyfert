## Hi there 👋, I am Sven.

    I am a software test engineer specializing in test automation.

### I am a husband, father, friend, son, IT geek and very involved.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on testautomation projects with an BDD approach.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about the proper usage of Design Pattern and Clean Code.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects in C#, AutoIt, Python and all kind of WebBasedStuff.
- 💬 Ask me about AutoIt! I worked with this language since many years.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I built my wooden house partly on my own.
